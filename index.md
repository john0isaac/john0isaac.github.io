Software and Data Engineer @ Orange Business, Microsoft MVP

Cairo, Egypt

## Summary

I'm a Software and Data Engineer with a strong focus on AI, cloud technologies, and community empowerment.
My journey blends hands-on technical expertise with a deep commitment to knowledge-sharing — both through code and conversations.

From building full-stack, cloud-native applications to contributing to open-source tools like the Azure Developer CLI,
I thrive at the intersection of engineering and innovation.
As a Microsoft AI MVP and Leader of the Azure Egypt User Group, I’ve hosted and spoken at events,
mentored early-career developers, and collaborated with Microsoft to grow regional tech ecosystems.

My mission? To craft reliable, scalable software solutions — and help others do the same.
Whether it’s through designing internal systems, automating workflows, or writing technical content for global audiences,
I bring a mix of precision, creativity, and heart to every project.

Let’s connect if you're passionate about AI, cloud,
or community-led growth - or if you're just down to geek out over cool tech.
